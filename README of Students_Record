******Initialize student data:******
The program starts with a string variable `studentData` that contains student records in a specific format. 
Each record consists of a student's name, followed by a colon and their score. The records are separated by commas and spaces.


*******Split data into individual records:******
  The program splits the `studentData` string into individual records using the `split(", ")` method, 
resulting in an array called `records`.


********Initialize arrays for student names and scores:*********
The program creates two arrays, `studentNames` and `studentScores`, to store the names and scores of the students. 
The size of these arrays is determined by the number of records.


*******Populate the arrays with data:**********
   - A loop goes through each record, splitting it using the colon (":") as a separator. It checks if each record has two parts
 (name and score). If not, it prints an error message and exits.
   - If the record is formatted correctly, it stores the student's name in the `studentNames` array and attempts to parse and store 
the score as an integer in the `studentScores` array. If parsing the score fails, it prints an error message and exits.


 *********Calculate and display statistics:************
   - The program initializes variables for the total score, highest score, and lowest score.
   - It also initializes strings for the names of the highest and lowest scorers.
   - Another loop goes through the students to calculate statistics:
     - It accumulates the total score.
     - It compares each student's score with the current highest and lowest scores, updating them if necessary.
     - It keeps track of the names of the students with the highest and lowest scores.
   
******Display the results:********
   - After processing all the records, the program prints the following statistics:
     - Total number of students.
     - Average score of all students (calculated by dividing the total score by the number of students).
     - Highest score achieved and the student who achieved it.
     - Lowest score achieved and the student who achieved it.
